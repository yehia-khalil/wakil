# Provider capacity: acceptance

**Spec:** [`2026-10-10-provider-capacity-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-10-provider-capacity-design.md) (amended 2026-10-11: the Claude probe) ·
**Plans:** [`2026-10-10-provider-capacity.md`](../superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-provider-capacity.md), [`2026-10-11-provider-capacity-probe.md`](../superpowers/plans/2026-10-11-provider-capacity-probe.md)

**Walked 2026-10-11 by the operator: all ten steps pass.** The first walk passed step 1 and
failed step 2: Claude Code 2.1.294+ no longer reports limits every turn. The source is now a
1-token probe per Claude account; this second walk passed.

The exit criterion, from the spec: with three accounts in an org, the operator can see from
the home window which one is low without opening anything, and choose between them in ⌘P or
Settings knowing both windows and both reset times.

The Cover rung's checks are in §3–§4. A real account's numbers, the colours, hover and
the ⌘P rows stay here.

## 1. The walk

Launch with `make app-bundle && open app/Wakil.app` in `/Users/operator/orca/workspaces/wakil/jarvis`.
Walk in an organisation with at least two Claude accounts (`personal` has a Max and a Team
account; `umbrella` has an Enterprise one). Keyboard navigation (System Settings → Keyboard) is
off unless a step says so. Each probe is a real 1-token request against that account's limit,
at most once a minute per account.

| # | Do | Expect | Walked |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Launch Wakil in `personal`; do nothing else | Within a few seconds, two violet hairlines (44 pt) beside ACCOUNT. No turn needed | ☑ |
| 2 | In Terminal: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-personal claude`, then `/usage` | Wakil's 5h and week figures (hover, step 4) match `/usage` within a point | ☑ |
| 3 | Run one turn on the active account | The hairlines update within a moment of the turn ending; the composer is never held up | ☑ |
| 4 | Hover the ACCOUNT cell | A card lists every provider in the org, the active one `IN USE`, each with 5H and WEEK rows, reset times and "as of". The composer keeps its caret | ☑ |
| 5 | Click the ACCOUNT cell, then type | The text lands in the composer: the click took no focus (Rule 6) | ☑ |
| 6 | Turn Keyboard navigation on, Tab to the ACCOUNT cell; turn it off after | The card opens on focus and closes when focus leaves | ☑ |
| 7 | Press ⌘P, type an account name | Each provider row's subtitle reads `5h N% · week M%`; a figure at 20% or less is amber, never red | ☑ |
| 8 | Open Settings → Providers | The strip sits above the accounts table, the table as before. An account with no stored token shows its own error whole; the others still draw (Rule 8) | ☑ |
| 9 | Switch organisation to `umbrella` | The previous org's figures are gone at once. The Enterprise account shows one hairline; hovering shows a MONTH row (`95% · 1 Nov` or so) | ☑ |
| 10 | Look at a Codex account, if any org has one | A 30-day-only Codex account reads `month N%` with a MONTH row | ☑ |

## 2. Residue — what the walk cannot establish

- **Terminal sessions' own usage** is not observed, but the probe reads the account's limit
  wherever it was spent, so a launch, a switch or a turn's end brings the figures up to date.
  Between those, a reading's "as of" says how old it is.
- **Cost:** each probe spends a 1-token request; the floor is one per account per minute.
- **Enterprise "month"** is the account's monthly spend limit (the `overage` headers), not a
  rate window.

## 3. Residue — what Cover could not reach, and why

Written by the e2e auditor (Cover rung, 2026-10-10; probe delta 2026-10-11). The checks are
`e2e/checks/seeded/capacity-{low-reading,passed-reset}.jsonl` and
`e2e/checks/agent/capacity-after-turn.jsonl` (the launch reading from a stub API, then a turn's).
The e2e harness answers the probe from a local stub and never reaches the real API.

- **Opening the card.** It opens on hover or on keyboard focus, and the cell takes focus only
  with Keyboard navigation on (`.focusable(interactions: .activate)`, for Rule 6). The
  vocabulary has no hover step, and the cell refuses AXFocused. `window.capacity` is in
  `uncoverable.tsv`. Walk steps 3–5.
- **The ⌘P subtitle.** Palette rows are buttons, and the window's tree prints no button text.
  The subtitle is pinned by `PaletteItems` unit tests. Walk step 6.
- **Colour.** Amber at 20% or less, violet otherwise, the dashed empty bar after a reset:
  not in the accessibility tree. The checks assert the figures; colour is walk step 6.
- **Geometry.** "Above an unchanged table" is asserted only as both being present. Walk step 7.
- **Rule 8, one account's error drawn whole while the others draw:** no step can corrupt a
  store file mid-run. Covered by Go and Swift tests.
- **Codex and local rows:** the fixture has only claude-code accounts, and a Codex row would
  read the real `~/.codex`. Go tests only.
- **A real account's numbers** against a live provider: walk step 2, the operator's alone.
- **The agent cannot make Wakil probe:** not visible in the tree; pinned by Swift tests.
- **Month-only display:** the fixture has one claude-code account and one stub answer.
  Swift tests and walk steps 9–10.
- **Probe cadence** (once a minute, which triggers): Go and Swift tests only.

## 4. The machine walk

<!-- machine-walk: generated by `make e2e-runbook`; everything between these markers is overwritten -->

**The machine walk is green:** every check ran against this build, every check this branch added was seen to fail against the merge-base, and the surface it added carries checks.

Walked by `make e2e` against 2e50a7f7b85c, rendered 2026-10-11 13:51 UTC by `make e2e-runbook`. Re-render it with that target; edits between the markers are overwritten.

**The tree carried uncommitted changes**, so these checks ran against that tree rather than against the commit named above.

**`make e2e-new` saw every check this branch added go red against 1402c099d411.**

**Every action and control this branch added carries a check.** 2 action(s) and 2 control(s) are new on this branch.

- actions:  33 of 75 dispatched by a check
- writes:   6 of 48 carry a parity check
- controls: 70 of 123 exercised by a check

**42 piece(s) of surface no check can reach**, each with the reason given in `e2e/checks/uncoverable.tsv`:

- `ctx_unlink_provider` — its parity: the click removes the binding, so the dispatch half cannot be given the same id. Dispatch and both channels' behaviour ARE covered by 2e-settings-unlink.jsonl; what no check can express is the comparison.
- `api_undo_fill` — its parity: the Undo click forgets the fill it undoes, and api_undo_fill refuses a pane with nothing to undo, so the dispatch half cannot be given the same state after the click — and a second fill between the halves is not expressible inside one parity step. Both channels ARE covered by api-paste-curl.jsonl, the click after one fill and the dispatch after another, each asserting the same restored draft through read_pane; what no check can express is the comparison.
- `ctx_add_provider` — its parity: the click creates a binding under an id, so a dispatch with the same params collides with what the click just made. Covered by 2e-settings-doors.jsonl up to the browser leg.
- `api_unbind` — its parity: the click returns the binding to its hole, and api_unbind refuses a position that holds no binding (`unbindNotABinding`), so the dispatch half cannot be given the same params — and a re-drag between the halves is not expressible. Both channels ARE covered by api-unbind.jsonl, each after its own drag, asserting the same hole back through read_pane; what no check can express is the comparison.
- `api_cancel` — its parity: the click cancels the send in flight, and api_cancel refuses a pane with nothing in flight (`nothingInFlight`), so the dispatch half cannot be given the same state — and a second Send between the halves is not expressible. Both channels ARE covered by api-cancel.jsonl, each after its own Send, asserting the same cancelled response through read_pane; what no check can express is the comparison.
- `ctx_provider_login` — #254. Opens a browser on the operator's machine and authenticates as them. No harness can drive it and none should: every run would leave a real credential behind.
- `api_render_curl` — Two reasons, and the second is the one that lasts. A dispatch cannot hold the row id, which is minted per send and published only in read_pane; and the operator's own Copy as cURL puts its line on the PASTEBOARD, which no check can read — the act is real and its result leaves the window. `api_reopen`'s CLICK left this file when the recent strip gave it a button, because a reopen's effect lands in the draft where a check can see it; its dispatch half is still here, for the first of these reasons. Covered by WakilKitTests: curlIsPastTenseOnly, curlOnlyMentionsACredentialThereWasOne, curlEmitsAndNeverParses.
- `capacity_record` — its parity: the operator's channel is the agent's own stream — the window records a `rate_limit_event` frame from a turn on its own, with no click or drag — so the UI half of a parity step cannot be expressed, on git_fold's precedent. Both channels ARE covered: the dispatch by capacity-low-reading.jsonl and capacity-passed-reset.jsonl, the stream by agent/capacity-after-turn.jsonl, each asserting the reading it lands on the indicator; what no check can express is the comparison.
- `settings_open` — its parity: the only UI path is the `Settings…` MENU item, and a menu's buttons are not in the accessibility tree until the menu is open — the same rule that excuses every other menu control. Checks drive it by its real gesture, cmd+comma, and 2e-settings-pane.jsonl also dispatches it.
- `api_fill_from_curl` — its parity: the UI half of a parity step is a click or a drag, and the operator's channel is a paste (cmd+v into the path editor), so the comparison cannot be expressed. Both channels ARE covered: the dispatch by api-paste-curl.jsonl, the paste by api-paste-curl-hotkey.jsonl, each asserting the same draft and the Filled from cURL line; what no check can express is the comparison.
- `git_unfold` — its parity (3a-i): the operator's channel is Esc — a key, not a click or a drag — so the UI half of a parity step cannot be expressed. The dispatch is covered by 3a-i-git-drill.jsonl (unfold keeps the selection, the list is back). The keyboard half is 3a-i-git-keys.jsonl: Esc unfolds with the same file selected.
- `db_remove_database` — its parity: the click removes the database, and removing one that is gone is refused (`no database … in environment …`), so the dispatch half cannot be given the same params. Dispatch is covered by 2e-settings-databases-dispatch.jsonl and the click by 2e-settings-databases.jsonl; what no check can express is the comparison.
- `api_reopen` — its dispatch: it needs a row id, which is minted per send and published only in read_pane — the same reason api_render_curl below is here. The operator's gesture IS covered: api-recent.jsonl presses api.recent.0.reopen and asserts the draft it rebuilds. Permanent, not blocked: nothing in the vocabulary carries a value from read_pane into a dispatch.
- `git_step` — its parity (3a-i): the operator's channel is ↑↓ with the diff open — keys, not a click or a drag — so the UI half of a parity step cannot be expressed, on api_fill_from_curl's precedent. The dispatch is covered by 3a-i-git-drill.jsonl (across roots, both directions, asserting the selection and the header through read_pane and the tree). The keyboard half is 3a-i-git-keys.jsonl: ↑↓ folded, across both roots, asserting the selection through read_pane.
- `git_fold` — its parity (3a-i): there is no operator control for it at all — GitPane folds only by selecting, so git_fold is the agent's alone and no UI half exists to compare. The dispatch is covered by 3a-i-git-drill.jsonl (fold again, the same file and position).
- `api.recent.<…>.curl` — Its whole effect is a string on the SYSTEM PASTEBOARD, which no check can read — the act is real and its result leaves the window, so a check could press it and assert nothing, which is the check-that-cannot-fail this file exists to prevent rather than permit. `TerminalPane`'s own Copy is silent for the same reason and carries no indicator. The line it copies is `apiRenderCurl`'s, covered by WakilKitTests: curlIsPastTenseOnly, curlOnlyMentionsACredentialThereWasOne, curlEmitsAndNeverParses. If this pane ever draws a "copied" acknowledgement, the act becomes observable and this line should go.
- `api.response.<…>` — the Body · Headers choice (W20) is drawn only over a reply, and no fixture host ever replies — every entry is `.invalid` or the never-answering `slow`, and wakil-http refuses http://. apiResponseOffersHeaders and apiResponseHeaderRows are pinned in ApiPaneLayoutTests; the drawn table is the runbook's check 5.
- `db.<…>.notFormatted` — display text, not a control: a static `Text` (DBPane.swift) carrying Format's refusal reason, with no press action, and the vocabulary addresses only `click`/`focus` by identifier while `expect.tree` matches by text, so no step can "press" it. Its content IS asserted: db-query-line-not-formatted.jsonl expects `not formatted: a string opened at character 39 never closes` in the tree, then its absence after the next edit.
- `git.diff` — the Monaco host's container (3a-i): an NSViewRepresentable holding the WKWebView, with no press action of its own. 3a-i-git-drill.jsonl asserts the web view is mounted (`HTML content` in the tree); what it shows is the operator's ruling (§5 tones), not a check's.
- `git.diffBanner` — a Text (3a-i): `binary · 2.1 MB` or `file is 3.0 MB · first 2 MB shown`, drawn only over a binary or oversized diff. Display text with no press action; its wording is pinned by WakilKitTests banners and smallBinarySizes, and wakil-git's caps by its Go tests.
- `git.diffError` — a Text (3a-i): a diff's error, drawn whole. Display text with no press action; the fixture's diffs all load, and `diff.error` is asserted null by 3a-i-git-drill.jsonl.
- `git.diffHeader` — a Text (3a-i): `root / path · n of N · ↑↓`. Read, not pressed — 3a-i-git-drill.jsonl asserts it at 1, 2, 4 and 5 of 5, across both roots.
- `git.loading` — the load tick (3a-i, Rule 5): a 2 pt shape drawn only while a read or a diff is in flight, which against the fixture's tiny repositories lasts a few milliseconds — never long enough for a tree read to see. Pinned by WakilKitTests theClickedRowCarriesTheLoadingMarkUntilItsDiffArrives; seeing it is the runbook's walk.
- `git.pane` — the git pane's container (3a-i): it holds the list or the spine and diff, has no press action, and refuses AXFocused (measured: axresolve not_focusable) — its keyboard focus is SwiftUI's own, given when the pane is focused. What it draws is read by every 3a-i check; its rows are `git.row:…`.
- `git.root:<…>` — a Text (3a-i): a root's header, `e2e-api · main` or `e2e-git · not a git repository`. Read, not pressed — 3a-i-git-list.jsonl asserts both, and 3a-i-git-live.jsonl asserts `e2e-portal · main · clean` once the root empties.
- `git.rootError:<…>` — a Text (3a-i): the second and later lines of a root's error, drawn whole beneath its header — and only when the error HAS a second line. The fixture's non-repository error is one line, so it is never drawn; its split is pinned by WakilKitTests aLongErrorIsSplitBetweenTheHeaderAndTheLinesBeneath, and a multi-line error is the runbook's walk.
- `palette.error` — a Text (palette rework, rule 8): a run's error, drawn whole under the query line. Display text with no press action. Read, not pressed — palette-run-error.jsonl asserts "no entry in staging has that host" with the step and the typed line still there.
- `palette.plane` — the palette's container (.contain, palette rework): it holds the header, the query line, the rows and the footer, and takes no input itself — the dimmer around it takes the dismissing click. Its contents are read by every palette-*.jsonl check ("OPEN OR SWITCH TO", "RUN A COMMAND", the "N of M" count); the field inside it is palette.query, typed into, and its rows are palette.row.<id>, pressed.
- `palette.step` — a Text (palette rework): an input step's title, uppercased, where the mode's name was. Read, not pressed — palette-command-step.jsonl and palette-escape.jsonl assert "PANE KIND", palette-run-error.jsonl "CURL COMMAND", palette-switch-environment.jsonl "ENVIRONMENT", palette-table-row.jsonl a drill's "BOOKINGS"; palette-escape.jsonl asserts it gone after one Esc.
- `settings.capacity.strip` — the Settings capacity strip's scroll container (provider capacity), which takes no input. Its rows are read by capacity-low-reading.jsonl and capacity-passed-reset.jsonl, beside the accounts table's own CREDENTIAL and SIGN-IN headers.
- `settings.login.cancel` — #254. Only exists while a browser trip is in flight.
- `settings.login.dismiss` — #254. Drawn only by the states a finished trip reaches — added, refused, cancelled, timedOut, uncertain, failed.
- `settings.login.someoneElse` — #254. Starts a fresh trip, and only appears when the config dir is already signed in, which itself needs a real credential.
- `settings.login.start` — #254. The control that does the above.
- `settings.mint.stopWaiting` — #254. Only exists while waiting on a live mint.
- `settings.org.speechProvider.note` — a Text: the Speech row's "unknown engine 'x', using Apple". Read, not pressed — 2d-ii-settings-speech.jsonl asserts it after a dispatched unknown id and a reload, and its absence after Apple is chosen.
- `settings.row.<…>.reauthenticate` — #254. Goes straight to the browser by design — no confirmation step — so pressing it IS starting a real trip.
- `window.capacity` — the capacity indicator beside ACCOUNT (provider capacity): it has no press action, and it refuses AXFocused (measured 2026-10-10: axresolve not_focusable), because `.focusable(interactions: .activate)` keeps a click from taking the composer's focus (Rule 6) and joins the key loop only with macOS Keyboard navigation on. Its card opens on hover or on that focus, and the vocabulary has no hover step, so opening the card is walk-only. What it draws is read by capacity-at-launch.jsonl (the launch probe, no turn), capacity-low-reading.jsonl, capacity-passed-reset.jsonl and agent/capacity-after-turn.jsonl.
- `window.composer.bar` — the composer bar's container (.contain), which holds the field, the heard text and the hint and takes no input itself. Its contents are read by every 2d-ii voice check; the field inside it is `window.composer`, which they type into.
- `window.composer.heard` — a Text: the words heard while ⌥ is held, or the notice that replaces them. Read, not pressed — 2d-ii-voice-silence.jsonl asserts "Hearing nothing from E2E Microphone" and the words that clear it; 2d-ii-voice-lands-unsent.jsonl and 2d-ii-voice-escape.jsonl assert the words mid-hold.
- `window.composer.hint` — a Text: the bar's hint. Read, not pressed — the keys hint ("TO SPEAK"), the listening hint ("RELEASE TO PUT IT IN THE LINE") and the landed hint ("HEARD · RETURN SENDS · EDIT FIRST") are asserted by the 2d-ii voice checks.
- `window.thread` — the thought thread's container (.contain), which takes hits only on its rows and the "earlier" line. Its rows are pressed by 2d-ii-thread-earlier.jsonl as window.thread.row.<id> and window.thread.earlier.

**This section knows nothing about what a machine cannot see.** The visual rulings and the live-provider question stay the operator's, permanently; they are the human section below.
